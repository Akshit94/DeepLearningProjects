##INTRODUCTION
In this project I have built a neural netowrk from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real Bike-Sharing dataset.  
I am building this project under the *Udacity's Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree program*.  
See Udacity's introduction to the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOwEDeJp8yw).

##GET STARTED
1. Clone the repository locally on your computer or download the zip file and unzip it.
2. __cd__ into the MyFirstNeuralNetwork.
3. Download _anaconda_ or _miniconda_ from the official website and install it.
4. Create a new conda environment:  
__conda create --name dlnd python=3__
5. Enter your new environment:  
    __Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd__  
    __Windows: >> activate dlnd__
6. Ensure you have _numpy_, _matplotlib_, _pandas_, and _jupyter notebook_ installed by doing the following:  
__conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook__
7. Run the following to open up the notebook:  
__jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb__
8. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
9. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook
