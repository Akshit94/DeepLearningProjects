##Introduction
In this project, I have classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset is first preprocessed, then I have trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples.  
I have normalized the images, one-hot encoded the labels, built a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, the network outputs the predictions on the sample images.  
I am building this project under the *Udacity's Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree program*.  
See Udacity's introduction to the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awEYy2Df3hg).  

##GET STARTED
1. Clone the repository locally on your computer or download the zip file and unzip it.
2. __cd__ into the ImageClassification folder.
3. See the instructions [here](https://github.com/ludwiktrammer/deep-learning/tree/master/image-classification) to make an account on FloydHub and run the network.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
5. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook
