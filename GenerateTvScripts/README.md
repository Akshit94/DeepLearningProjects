## INTRODUCTION  
In this project, I have generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I have used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons.  
The Neural Network I have built will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.   
I am building this project under the *Udacity's Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree program*.  
See Udacity's introduction to the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNpv7IjQzo0).  

## GET STARTED  
1. Clone the repository locally on your computer or download the zip file and unzip it.
2. __cd__ into the GenerateTvScripts folder.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
4. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook
